# Web Shop

This project represents an online store for the sale of sports equipment. We have used a range of modern technologies to provide a better user experience.

# The technologies used in this project include:

- Next.js
- GraphQL
- Keystone
- MongoDB
- TypeScript
- Apollo Client

# Project Description

The goal of this project is to provide a platform where users can easily and intuitively purchase sports equipment. Our web shop is built using Next.js, which enables us to create a fast and efficient website. We use GraphQL to quickly retrieve data from the database, while Keystone serves as the backend framework for data management.

# How to Run the Project

To run the project, you need to run the frontend and backend separately:

## Running the Backend

1. Download the project or clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the `backend` directory in the project using your terminal.
3. Install dependencies using the `npm install` command.
4. Start the backend server using the `npm run dev` command.
5. Once the backend server is running successfully, open `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser to use the application.

## Running the Frontend

1. Open a new terminal window.
2. Navigate to the `frontend` directory in the project.
3. Install dependencies using the `npm install` command.
4. Start the frontend server using the `npm run dev` command.
5. Once the frontend server is running successfully, open `http://localhost:7777` in your web browser to use the application.

Note: We recommend running the backend server first and then the frontend server.
